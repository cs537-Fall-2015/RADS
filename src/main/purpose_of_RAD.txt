RAD's primary science objectives are to:

-Characterize the energetic particle spectrum at the surface of Mars
-Determine the radiation dose for humans on the surface of Mars
-Enable validation of Mars atmospheric transmission models and radiation transport codes
-Provide input to the determination of the radiation hazard and mutagenic influences to life, past and present, at and beneath the Martian surface
-Provide input to the determination of the chemical and isotopic effects of energetic particles on the Martian surface and atmosphere
